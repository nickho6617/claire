## Getting Started
---------------

This app is designed to be used as a public-facing registration tool for volunteers at a recycling project. It's built using Streamlit and Python, with the necessary dependencies installed via pip.

### Prerequisites

* Install the required dependencies: `streamlit`, `smtplib`, `ssl`, etc.
* Make sure you have a working email account configured (SMTP server and password).

## Requirements
-------------

* Python 3.11+
* Streamlit 1.12+
* smtplib 3.10+
* ssl 3.8+
* email 1.5+

## How to Use
------------

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app using Streamlit: `streamlit run main.py`

The app will launch in your default browser, where you can enter and submit volunteer registration details.

## Configuration Options
---------------------

This app uses environment variables to configure its behavior:

* `SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address used for sending notifications.
* `SENDER_PASSWORD`: The password associated with the sender's email account.
* `SMTP_SERVER`: The SMTP server URL (e.g., "smtp.example.com").
* `SMTP_PORT`: The SMTP port number (default: 587).
* `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`: The recipient's email address.

You can update these environment variables in your local configuration or via the Streamlit settings menu (if you're running the app locally).
